Dig World Realms is a game about an archaeologist exploring tombs! Watch out
for boulders ("0"), and be sure to snag the valuable treasure chests ("n").
Once you grab the relic ("%") at the end of each tomb, you'll need to make it
past the spike traps ("^", "<", ">" and "v"), arrow traps ("}" and "{") that
it activates!

If you get stuck, try reverting to the previous checkpoint! They are saved
every time you re-enter the tomb from the surface, back to the beginning of
the current tomb.

You explore this strange world by entering sequences of commands, each of
which is a single letter. For example, if you want to dig right, you can type
"r" and hit enter. If you want to dig right four times, you can type "rrrr" --
or "4r", to save keystrokes! You can also queue up commands like "3d3u" to go
down three times, then up three times. The game will tell you what commands 
are available to you at any given time!

Changes from Dig World:
- Replaced explit saves with checkpointing when you're at the surface.
- Designed levels rather than randomized, with story scenes before and after.
- Removed parachute and helmet.
- Changed the % from a gate to a relic. You need to return to the surface
  to advance to the next level.
- Added arrow and spike traps that activate after you pick up the relic.
