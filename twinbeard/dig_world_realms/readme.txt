Dig World is a game an archaeologist exploring tombs! Watch out for
boulders ("0"), and be sure to snag the valuable treasure chests ("n"). Once
you grab the relic ("%") at the end of each tomb, you'll need to make it past
the spike traps ("^", "<", ">" and "v"), arrow traps ("}" and "{") that it
activates!

You explore this strange world by entering sequences of commands, each of
which is a single letter. For example, if you want to dig right, you can type
"r" and hit enter. If you want to dig right four times, you can type "rrrr" --
or "4r", to save keystrokes! You can also queue up commands like "3d3u" to go
down three times, then up three times. The game will tell you what commands are
available to you at any given time!
