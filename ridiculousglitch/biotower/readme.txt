Biohazard Tower
by Goat <goat@ridiculousglitch.com>

The player goes down from a tower full of zombies and tries to kill them all
one level at a time. In each level, the player can encounter zombies but also
find useful items, like medikits and ammunitions. The player has two
corresponding resources, that are health and ammos, and must choose when
to enter the next level and when to leave. The player can also find doors,
that once opened can contain zombies, medikits, ammos or other doors.
