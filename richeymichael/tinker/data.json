    "intro": "The game was originally created for the Decktet. 'The Decktet is a collection of cards with suits, ranks, and named images. It is the kind of tarot deck they use in the alternate universe where Charlemagne was a badger, if you can imagine such a thing.' - P.D. Magnus\n\nYou are the lowly tinker. A strange wizard has charged you, the Tailor, the Soldier, and the Sailor with defeating an evil that has taken over the world. The wizard gave you enough power to cast 36 magic spells, 6 for each of the 6 powers in the world. During your adventure you and your company will recruit new members by breaking the evils spells on them or master exciting events. The skills you gain from these events and these new members will bring more power to your group. When you are ready you will leave on your adventure ridding each region of the world of evil. If you fail in your quest, the world will be no more.",
    "help": "Preparing for your adventure: You will be given the option between recruiting a team member or experiencing a new event. Either option will give you a skill, the maginitude of which will be indicated by a number of points. The person or event will have a subset (up to 3) of powers associated with it. To remove an evil spell from a person you meet or overcome an event you'll have to gather an equal (or larger) force in the same powers. If you don't feel up to the challenge you can flee. However, when you begin traveling the world you will not be able to flee challenges, rid the world of evil or die.\n \n Example:\n >    -----------------------------------------------------------------\n >    Recruit a member or gain experience:\n >    -----------------------------------------------------------------\n >    1) the Watchman pts: 11  powers: MOONS, WYRMS, KNOTS desc: A grey koala wearing a green and yellow robe\n >    2) the Chance Meeting pts: 7  powers: LEAVES, MOONS desc: A grey mouse with a staff encounters a goose with a sword wearing brown\n \n You can choose to experience a chance meeting, thus gaining a skill worth 7 LEAVES or 7 MOONS (not both), but to do so you'll have to gather up at least 7 LEAVES or MOONS to gain the skill. If you don't want to go for that you can try to remove the evil curse from the Watchman. The Watchman will join your party if you remove the curse. You automatically get the first move:\n \n >    -----------------------------------------------------------------\n >    Your side of the struggle:\n >    -----------------------------------------------------------------\n >    the Soldier pts: 5  powers: WYRMS, KNOTS desc: A fierce fighting mouse with an ax, spear, and saber\n >\n >    Relevant strength: 5   Magic: 0   Relevant powers: KNOTS, WYRMS\n >\n >    -----------------------------------------------------------------\n >    The other side of the struggle:\n >    -----------------------------------------------------------------\n >    the Watchman pts: 11  powers: MOONS, WYRMS, KNOTS desc: A grey koala wearing a green and yellow robe\n \n The Soldier steps up and has got KNOTS power of 5, not enough to overcome the curse on the Watchman. You will be given a choice to abandon the Watchman or cast a spell for another move. Remember you only have 36 powers (6 of each power), spend them wisely.\n \n >    -----------------------------------------------------------------\n >    Choose your next action: \n >    -----------------------------------------------------------------\n >    1) flee\n >    2) use a spell\n \n In this case we're going to cast a spell. You'll be given a choice of which power to use. Any power will give you another move; however, if you use a power you need it will act as a bonus during your current trial and will be scored under magic. In the case of our example, the Watchman, we will use KNOTS power to give us a bonus point.\n \n >    -----------------------------------------------------------------\n >    Select type of spell to cast\n >    -----------------------------------------------------------------\n >    1) KNOTS x 5\n >    2) MOONS x 5\n >    3) SUNS x 5\n >    4) LEAVES x 5\n >    5) WYRMS x 4\n >    6) WAVES x 6\n >\n >    Select an option from above (1-6, h, or s): 1\n >    A KNOTS spell increases your magic during this trial\n >    Casting a spell...\n \n Again you'll be confronted with the option of fleeing or continuing to try to save the Watchman.\n \n Good luck!\n \n ",
