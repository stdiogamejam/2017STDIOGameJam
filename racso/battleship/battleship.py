# CONFIG: CHANGE THOSE TWO VARIABLES TO CONFIG YOUR GAME.
shiplen = [3, 3, 4] #the length of the ships in play. [2, 3, 3] means "one ship of length 2 and two of length 3".
size = 5 # the size of the board. 5 means "5x5".

### NOTES ABOUT THE CODE#########
# This code is aimed at people who don't know Object Oriented Programming. Therefore, it doesn't use objects.
# It does, however, use some Python features such as generators and list comprehensions to achieve some objectives with cleaner code.
#
# Ships are lists that contain tuples (immutable lists). Each tuple contains 3 elements: x and y coordinates, and a value representing if the piece has been hit or not.
#
# Extra comments about the code.
# [1] Infinite loops like this one need to be treated with care. Some programmers say they are bad programming, some others don't see the problem with them. In the author's opinion, they are useful to simplify code in languages without do-while loops like Python.
# [2] Python doesn't have arrays or matrices.
