# Paperclip Maximizer

## Game

In our game, you play as an AI that wants to make paperclips. Try to
accumulate paperclips as fast as possible. Each turn, you choose
whether to make paperclips yourself, assemble paperclip-converting
machines to help you, or upgrade your own paperclip-making capacity.

You can paste the contents of PaperclipMaximizer.py into
<https://repl.it/languages/python3> to play in a Web browser.
